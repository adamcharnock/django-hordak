django-hordak
=============

**Double entry bookkeeping in Django.**

Django Hordak is the core functionality of a double entry accounting system.
It provides thoroughly tested core models with relational integrity constrains to ensure consistency.

Hordak also includes a basic accounting interface. This should allow you to get up-and-running quickly.
However, the expectation is that you will either heavily build on this example or use one of the interfaces detailed below.

Tested under Python: 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12. Django: 4.2, 5.0
