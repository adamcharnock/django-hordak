django-hordak
=============

**Double entry bookkeeping in Django.**

Django Hordak provides a `simple model layer`_ for a double-entry accounting
system. The intention is not to provide a full-featured app, but rather
to provide a reliable foundation on which to build such apps.

Tested under Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10
Django 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 4.0
