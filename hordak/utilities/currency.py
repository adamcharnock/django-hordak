Overview
--------

Hordak features multi currency support. Each account in Hordak can support one or more currencies.
Hordak does provide currency conversion functionality, but should be as part of the display logic
only. It is also a good idea to make it clear to users that you are showing converted values.

The preference for Hordak internals is to always store & process values in the intended currency. This
is because currency conversion is an inherently lossy process. Exchange rates vary over time, and rounding
errors mean that currency conversions are not reversible without data loss (e.g. ¥176.51 -> $1.54 -> ¥176.20).

Classes
-------

``Money`` **instances**:

    The ``Money`` class is provided by `moneyd`_ and combines both an amount and
    a currency into a single value.
    Hordak uses these these as the core unit of monetary value.

``Balance`` **instances (see below for more details)**:

    An account can hold multiple currencies, and a `Balance`_ instance is how we represent this.

    A `Balance`_ may contain one or more ``Money`` objects. There will be precisely one ``Money`` object
    for each currency which the account holds.

    Balance objects may be added, subtracted etc. This will produce a new `Balance`_ object containing a
    union of all the currencies involved in the calculation, even where the result was zero.

    Accounts with ``is_bank_account=True`` may only support a single currency.

Caching
-------

Currency conversion makes use of Django's cache. It is therefore recommended that you
`setup your Django cache`_ to something other than the default in-memory store.

    """Exchange funds from one currency to another

    Use this method to represent a real world currency transfer. Note this
    process doesn't care about exchange rates, only about the value
    of currency going in and out of the transaction.

    You can also record any exchange fees by syphoning off funds to
    ``fee_account`` of amount ``fee_amount``. Note
    that the free currency must be the same as the source currency.

    Examples:

        For example, imagine our Canadian bank has obligingly transferred 120 CAD into our US bank account.
        We sent CAD 120, and received USD 100. We were also changed 1.50 CAD in fees.

        We can represent this exchange in Hordak as follows::

            from hordak.utilities.currency import currency_exchange

            currency_exchange(
                # Source account and amount
                source=cad_cash,
                source_amount=Money(120, 'CAD'),
                # Destination account and amount
                destination=usd_cash,
                destination_amount=Money(100, 'USD'),
                # Trading account the exchange will be done through
                trading_account=trading,
                # We also incur some fees
                fee_destination=banking_fees,
                fee_amount=Money(1.50, 'CAD')
            )

        We should now find that:

         1. ``cad_cash.balance()`` has decreased by ``CAD 120``
         2. ``usd_cash.balance()`` has increased by ``USD 100``
         3. ``banking_fees.balance()`` is ``CAD 1.50``
         4. ``trading_account.balance()`` is ``USD 100, CAD -120``

        You can perform ``trading_account.normalise()`` to discover your unrealised gains/losses
        on currency traded through that account.

    Args:
        source (Account): The account the funds will be taken from
        source_amount (Money): A ``Money`` instance containing the inbound amount and currency.
        destination (Account): The account the funds will be placed into
        destination_amount (Money): A ``Money`` instance containing the outbound amount and currency
        trading_account (Account): The trading account to be used.
            The normalised balance of this account will indicate
            gains/losses you have made as part of your activity via this account.
            Note that the normalised balance fluctuates with the current exchange rate.
        fee_destination (Account): Your exchange may incur fees. Specifying this will move incurred fees
            into this account (optional).
        fee_amount (Money): The amount and currency of any incurred fees (optional).
        description (str): Description for the transaction.
            Will default to describing funds in/out & fees (optional).
        date (datetime.date): The date on which the transaction took place. Defaults to today (optional).

    Returns:
        (Transaction): The transaction created
